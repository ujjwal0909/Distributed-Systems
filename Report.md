System Proposal
My project is a Distributed Music Queue System that allows multiple users across different nodes to collaboratively build, manage, and play a shared music playlist. Users will be able to add tracks, vote to prioritize songs, and synchronize the queue across the distributed system. The system will also maintain playback history and provide metadata about tracks to all connected clients.

Functional Requirements

Users can add or remove tracks from the shared queue.

Users can vote tracks up or down to adjust their order in the queue.

The queue state is synchronized across distributed nodes.

Clients can retrieve and view track metadata (title, artist, duration).

The system stores playback history for later review.
